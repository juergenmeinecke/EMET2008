     Stata help and support

     The Social Science Computing Cooperative at the University of Wisconsin provides excellent
     support for Stata beginners. Check out their website "Stata for Students":

     This website should be your first port of call in all things Stata.

     Furthermore, the UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education provides fantastic resources
     for people who are interested in learning Stata:
