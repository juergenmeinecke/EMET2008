.. note:: 

    * August 26: 
      
          +   updated reading list

          +   typo in assignment, exercise 1c: the words "per capita real output" should be replaced with the
              words "sulfur dioxide concentration"

          +   added solution do-file to empirical exercise 6.3; this contains two equivalent ways of
              testing for heteroskedasticity; solution is posted under 'Week 4 Exercises' (use link
              on left)

          +   for the September 2 lecture, please come up with questions or suggestions for what you
              would like me to cover (just shoot me an e-mail); I'm happy to review Assignment 1
              and, in addition, answer any questions related to the class material

          +   reminder: midterm will be on Thursday of week 7 during the tute at the usual location
