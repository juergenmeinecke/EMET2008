Reading List
*************

.. note:: 

    This reading list assists you in finding the textbook sections that cover the material discussed
    during that week's lecture and practice session. Occasionally, the references provided in the table
    below go beyond what was discussed in class. In those cases, the reading is only *recommended* for
    deepening your understanding; it is, however, not required.
