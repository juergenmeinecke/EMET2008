Exercises
***************

.. note:: 
   
    Answers to exercises will only be provided during class time. If you cannot make it to class,
    you will need to see me during consultation times and we will work through the exercises
    together. (When you see me during consultation times, I expect you to be prepared. I will never
    merely provide answers to exercises. Instead, I want to see good faith effort on your part in
    which case I will be more than happy to help you work throught the exercises.) 

Week 1
=======

Problem Solving
--------------------

#) Prove that the sample average :math:`\bar{Y}` is an unbiased estimator for the population mean.    

#) Prove that in the linear model :math:`Y_i = \mu + \varepsilon_i` the ordinary least squares
   estimator of :math:`\mu` is equal to the sample average. Mathematically, minimize the sum of
   least squares :math:`\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{\mu})^2` and show that this is obtained by setting
   :math:`\hat{\mu} = \bar{Y}`.

#) Is there a difference between an estimator and an estimate?


Computational
--------------------

We will use this first practice session to become familiar with Stata. 

#)  Work through the "Stata for Researchers" website, you can find the link below.

#)  Empirical Exercise E4.2 from the Stock and Watson book will make for a good warm-up session. Try to
    answer parts a and b.

I will use this exercise to teach you some basic tricks you should know about Stata. For Stata help
and support I can highly recommend the following two sources:


*   The Social Science Computing Cooperative at the University of Wisconsin provides excellent
    support for Stata beginners. Check out their website "Stata for Students":
        
    <http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/stata_students1.htm>

    Also, check out their website "Stata for Researchers":
        
    <http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/sfr-intro.htm>

    This website should be your first port of call in all things Stata.

*   Furthermore, the UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education provides fantastic resources
    for people who are interested in learning Stata:

    <http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/>

Feel free to use these links throughout the semester to improve your Stata skills!
