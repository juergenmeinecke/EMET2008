Course Outline
***************************

Read this entire course outline carefully! 

Any items, rules, requirements in this course outline may be subject to changes. When this happens I
will announce it during the lecture. Announcements in the lecture supersede any information
contained in this course outline.


Course Description 
============================
This course presents and develops techniques necessary for the quantitative analysis of economic and
business problems that are beyond the scope of the simple linear regression model covered in
EMET2007. The course will deepen students understanding of the statistical foundations of
econometrics. The course provides an introduction to estimation and hypothesis testing in non-linear
models. It also examines model selection and specification analysis. Specific applications may
include instrumental variables estimation, panel data estimation, discrete choice and limited
dependent variable models, censored and truncated regression models as well as sample selection
models. Use of computer software provides the opportunity to employ the methods in application from
actual economic and business case studies.


Learning Outcome 
----------------------------

Ideally, at the end of this course you will

* have developed a sound understanding of the econometric techniques described above;

* be able to apply the appropriate econometric technique to a specific data or survey problem;

* think clearly about the relationship between data, model and estimation in econometrics;

* know the most important Stata commands and be able to use them to estimate particular econometric
  models.

I will frequently make announcements on the homepage of the Course Website (under "Announcements").

The official forum for announcements of any kind are the lectures. If necessary, I will contact
students electronically using their official ANU student e-mail address. If you want to contact me
send an e-mail to ::

    juergen.meinecke@anu.edu.au

E-mail addresses are only to be used when you need to contact staff about administrative or academic
matters. They are NOT to be used for instructional purposes. 

Textbook 
----------------------------

The textbook for the course is *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* 5ed, by Wooldridge.
Chiefly library has several copies of the textbook. I strongly recommend that you buy a copy of the
book as I base lecture and tutorials on it. 

Other excellent textbooks include *A Guide to Modern Econometrics* by Verbeek and *Introduction to
Econometrics* by Stock and Watson.


Software
------------

The econometric software for this course is "Stata". Here's a quick wiki summary of what Stata is:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata>. From my own experience, Stata is an exhaustive,
well-documented, powerful yet very user-friendly statistical software. (In fact so much so that some
consider it to be almost too easy to use!). 

I posted some introduction and guides on the course homepage. We will get to know Stata during the
tutorial in a "learning-by-doing manner".

========================    ==================      ==========

Note, all assessment items are **compulsory**. If you miss any one item without approval by the
School or College, you may fail the entire course!

Midterm Examination
--------------------------

The midterm examination is expected to be held during week 8 (23/09/2013 -- 27/09/2013) outside the
usual lecture times (usually after 6pm). The exam covers material from weeks 1 through 6 of the
lecture (and weeks 2 through 7 of the tutorials). Participation in the midterm exam is *compulsory*.
The exam will be marked out of 100.

It is your responsibility to make yourselves available for the midterm examination during week 8.
Details of the midterm exam will be announced as soon as the date is set and the venue is secured
(the ANU examination office usually sets dates and times by the middle of August). As soon as I find
out I will announce the exact date and time of the midterm exam in the lecture.

No make-up midterm examination will be offered. Should you miss the midterm exam for a valid reason
(see Special Examinations below) then your grade will be based solely on your final exam.

Final Examination
--------------------------

Examinable material covers the whole semester, including material already covered in the midterm
exam. Participation in the final exam is *compulsory* The exam will be marked out of 100.

The final exam will be held in the exam period at the end of the semester. Details will be posted on
the ANU exam timetable site. 

Scaling of Grades
--------------------

Final scores for the course will be determined by scaling the raw score totals to fit a sensible
distribution of grades. Scaling can increase or decrease a mark but does not change the order of
marks relative to the other students in the course. If it is decided that scaling is appropriate,
then the final mark awarded in a course may differ from the aggregation of the raw marks of each
assessment component.


Rules and Policies
============================


Special Examinations
--------------------------

Both the midterm examination and the final examination are *compulsory* However, if you are unable
to attend a scheduled examination due to *extraordinary circumstances* you may apply for a special
examination. For details, check the ANU `Special Examinations Policy
<http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/special-examinations/>`_

*Extraordinary circumstances* may include hospitalisation, inability to walk, or being so
incapacitated that you cannot attend the examination room. For additional grounds for a special
examination please read the `Special Examinations Protocol
<http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/special-examinations/special-examination-protocol/>`_.
The Special Examinations Protocol also lists in more detail circumstances that do NOT warrant
special examination. 

When applying for a special examination you are required to provide appropriate evidence for
non--attendance. In the case of illness or accident you must attend a doctor or medical clinic on
the day of the examination, unless there are special and documented circumstances, and provide a
medical certificate or police report where relevant. Please read the `Special Examinations Protocol
<http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/special-examinations/special-examination-protocol/>`_
for more details regarding appropriate evidence and medical documentation.

If you have an ongoing medical condition you are advised to register with the Disability Services
Centre. The Special Examinations policy is designed for short-term, unexpected illness. The
Disability Services Centre is able to provide more practical solutions to long term medical
conditions.

Requests for a Special Examination must be made on the standard University Application for `Special
Examination Form <http://www.anu.edu.au/sas/forms/special_exam.pdf>`_. The completed Special
Examination Form should be submitted to:

* Mid-Semester Examinations: Research School of Economics * Final Examinations: CBE Student Office

Applications lodged more than 3 working days after the date of the examination will not normally be
accepted.

Do not assume that non-attendance at the examination and an application will lead to a special
examination being given. The granting of a Special Examination is solely at the College's discretion
and provision of a medical certification does not necessarily guarantee the granting of a special
examination. The College will judge the severity based on the medical report and taking into account
all relevant factors.

Workload
--------------------------

University study requires at least as much time and effort as a full--time job. You are expected to
attend all lectures and tutorials (4 hours per week). You should expect to put in at least 6 hours
per week of your own study time for this course in addition to the 4 hours of lectures and
tutorials. 

---------------------

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations and the policies
and procedures that are relevant to your studies at the ANU. The following two links direct you to
websites that contain information about proper academic conduct, academic honesty and plagiarism,
discrimination, harassment and bullying, as well as examination policies (covering special
considerations, supplementary examinations, and special examinations). You are expected to be aware
of these policies: 

* `Policies and Procedures <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/policies-and-procedures/>`_  
* `Examinations and Assessment <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/>`_

If you seek more information, please feel free to visit the College Office (room 2.01 CBE Building
26C) to talk to a student administrator.


Supplementary Examinations
----------------------------

Should you receive a mark of :math:`PX` you will be required to take a *written supplementary exam*.
No other form of supplementary assessment will be offered (e.g., no oral examinations). None of you
should ignore the possibility of having to take the supplementary exam. When you enroll in this
course you implicitly agree to be able to take a supplementary exam, should it be required of you,
at the *end of February 2015* (it will be your responsibility to contact the course administrator to
inquire about the exact date). You are required to factor this into your planning for the coming
summer. I do not accept requests for early supplementary exams.



Misconduct
----------------------------

In relation to an examination, misconduct on the part of a student includes:

* cheating;
* plagiarism (including the reproducing in, or submitting for assessment for, any examination, by
  way of copying, paraphrasing or summarizing, without acknowledgement and with the intention to
  deceive, any work of another person as the student's own work, with or without the knowledge or
  consent of that other person);
* submitting for an examination any work previously submitted for examination (except with the
  approval of the prescribed authority);
* failing to comply with the University's instructions to students at, or in relation to, an
  examination;
* acting, or assisting another person to act dishonestly, in or in connection with an examination;
* taking a prohibited document into an examination venue.

The administrative procedures regarding misconduct are incorporated in the ANU `Discipline Rules
<http://about.anu.edu.au/__documents/rules/disciplinerules.pdf>`_.
