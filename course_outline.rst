Course Outline
***************************

Read this entire course outline carefully! 

Any items, rules, requirements in this course outline may be subject to changes. When this happens I
will announce it during the lecture. Announcements in the lecture supersede any information
contained in this course outline.


Course Description 
============================

This course presents and develops techniques necessary for the quantitative analysis of economic and
business problems that are beyond the scope of the simple linear regression model covered in
EMET2007 or STAT2008. Topics include: endogeneity, natural experiments, binary dependent variables,
time series regressions and panel data estimation.  This is a hand-on course with a focus on
applications in economics as well as business. A standard statistical software will be used during
computer sessions, no special programming skills are required.


Learning Outcome 
----------------------------

Upon successful completion of the requirements for this course, students will 

* understand the challenges of empirical modelling in economics and business

* understand the shortcomings of the standard linear regression model

* be able to apply important extensions to the linear regression model
  
* be able to express new econometric methods mathematically

* be able to think clearly about the relationship between data, model and estimation in econometrics

* use statistical software to study actual data sets 


Topics Covered
----------------

I intend to teach the following set of topics.

* Brief review of OLS estimation (2 weeks)

* Endogeneity: when OLS fails (1 week)

* Instrumental variables estimation (2 weeks)

* Experiments and quasi-experiments (2 weeks)

* Binary dependent variables (2 weeks)

* Panel data and time series models (4 weeks)

If you are interested in any other topic not given here, feel free to let me know as I am happy to
adapt the course and incorporate your ideas and preferences. Note that the indicated number of weeks
given within parentheses are just estimates and may differ as we go along.   

Prerequisites
---------------

To enrol in this course you must have completed

* ECON1101 and

* EMET2007 or STAT2008.


 

Communication 
---------------


.. important:: The official website for this course is 
   
   <http://EMET2008.Readthedocs.org>

I will frequently make announcements on the homepage of the Course Website (under "Announcements").

The official forum for announcements of any kind are the lectures. If necessary, I will contact
students electronically using their official ANU student e-mail address. If you want to contact me
send an e-mail to ::

    juergen.meinecke@anu.edu.au

E-mail addresses are only to be used when you need to contact staff about administrative or academic
matters. They are NOT to be used for instructional purposes. 

Textbook 
----------------------------

The textbook for the course is *Introduction to Econometrics* (third edition, 2012) by Stock and
Watson. Chiefly library has several copies of the textbook. I strongly recommend that you buy a
copy of the book as I base the lecture and practice sessions on it. 

Other excellent textbooks include *A Guide to Modern Econometrics* by Verbeek and *Introductory
Econometrics: A Modern Approach* 5ed, by Wooldridge.

Software
------------

The econometric software for this course is "Stata". Here's a quick wiki summary of what Stata is:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata>. From my own experience, Stata is an exhaustive,
well-documented, powerful and user-friendly statistical software. 

I posted some introduction and guides on the course homepage. We will get to know Stata during the
tutorial in a "learning-by-doing manner".

Lectures and Tutorials
-------------------------

There will be four hours of contact time per week: a two hour lecture and a two hour practice
session. You are expected to attend all of these. If you have persistent time conflicts with any of
these class sessions, you should not be taking the course. Although content will be made available
digitally (for example through audio recordings) you should not treat virtual attendance as a perfect
substitute for physical attendance. 

The class meets in the following venues at the following times:

=============== =============== ================ ==================
Day             Tuesday         Thursday         Thursday
=============== =============== ================ ==================
Type            Lecture         Problem Solving  Computing Session
Time            10-12           10-11            11-12 
Location        CBE Bld LT4     COP GO25         COP GO25
=============== =============== ================ ==================

As you can see, the two hour practice sessions happen on Thursdays and can be subdivided into a one
hour problem solving session and a one hour computing session. We will not always treat these two
sub-sessions as strictly separate and instead regard the two as one big practice session that
combines both theoretical exercises with computing exercises. 


Digital Lecture Delivery
--------------------------

Audio recordings of the Tuesday lecture will be made available on Wattle. 

The Thursday sessions (tute and computing) will not be made available on Wattle (they are group
learning sessions and as such do not lend themselves to audio recordings).

Workload
--------------------------

University study requires at least as much time and effort as a full--time job. You are expected to
attend all lectures and tutorials (4 hours per week). You should expect to put in at least 6 hours
per week of your own study time for this course in addition to the 4 hours of lectures and
tutorials. 





Course Assessment
========================

The following table summarizes the assessable items for the course.

===============================    ==================      ========== 
Assessment Item                    Due date                Weight
===============================    ==================      ========== 
Assignment 1                       Friday, week 5          10%

Midterm exam                       Week 7                  25%

Assignment 2                       Friday, week 13         10%

Final exam                         TBA                     45%

Practice session participation     Throughout              10%
===============================    ==================      ==========

Note, all assessment items are **compulsory**. If you miss any one item without approval by the
School or College, you will fail the entire course!


Assignments 
------------ 

Working through exercises is an effective method of learning econometrics, as it is with most
mathematical subjects. That means that the assignments are more than simply part of the assessment
for the course. Students will be required to submit two written assignments during the semester.

The assignments will require computer work as well as analytical work. These assignments should be
your own work. You may discuss assignments with classmates, but you should do all your own
computing and writing of the assignments. It is an offense against the University’s regulations to
copy from other students’ assignments.  

Assignments should be submitted by dropping them into a specially labeled assignment box at the
Research School of Economics. (Contact Terry Embling for details.) The front page of the submitted
assignments must show your name, student number and the course name (EMET2008). Assignments missing
any of this information will receive a mark of zero.  

Assignments must be submitted by 12pm on the due date. If you have a
university approved excuse for not handing in an assignment, then the value of the final exam will
be increased by 10 percentage points to compensate for the missed work.  

Further details about assignment submission will be given during lectures.

Midterm Examination
--------------------------

The midterm examination will be held during practice session time on Thursday of week 7. The exam
covers all material from weeks 1 through 6 of the course. The exam will be marked out of 100. It is
your responsibility to make yourself available for the midterm examination.

No make-up midterm examination will be offered. Should you miss the midterm exam for a valid reason
(see Special Examinations below) then your grade will be based solely on your final exam.

Final Examination
--------------------------

Examinable material covers the whole semester, including material already covered in the midterm
exam. The exam will be marked out of 100.

The final exam will be held in the exam period at the end of the semester. Details will be posted on
the ANU exam timetable site. 


Practice Session Participation
----------------------------------

Your participation is an essential part in the overall learning experience (both for you as well as
your classmates!) in the course. I will evaluate you on your participation during the Thursday
practice sessions. Feel free to participate and contribute to the sessions. Do not be afraid to give
`wrong` answers; as long as you are constructively engaged, there is no such thing as a wrong answer. 

Every Thursday after practice sessions I will take note of students who participated in class and at
the end of the semester I will aggregate these numbers to an overall participation mark. Roughly, I
will give 10 marks to regular participators, 5 marks to occasional participators and zero marks to
students who rarely or never participate. Feel free to seek feedback from me during the semester on
your participation performance.


Scaling of Grades
--------------------

Final scores for the course will be determined by scaling the raw score totals to fit a sensible
distribution of grades. Scaling can increase or decrease a mark but does not change the order of
marks relative to the other students in the course. If it is decided that scaling is appropriate,
then the final mark awarded in a course may differ from the aggregation of the raw marks of each
assessment component.


Rules and Policies
============================

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations and the policies
and procedures that are relevant to your studies at the ANU. 

ANU has educational policies, procedures and guidelines, which are designed to ensure that staff and
students are aware of the University's academic standards, and implement them. You can find the
University's education policies and an explanatory glossary at: `ANU Policies
<http://policies.anu.edu.au/ Students>`_.

Students are expected to have read the `Student Academic Integrity Policy <http://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_000392>`_
before the commencement of their course.  

Other key policies include: 

* Student Assessment (Coursework) 
  
* Student Surveys and Evaluations

The University also offers a number of support services for students. Information on these is available
online from `ANU Studentlife <http://students.anu.edu.au/studentlife/>`_.
